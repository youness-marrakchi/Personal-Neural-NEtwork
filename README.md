# Personal-Neural-NEtwork
This repository contains a fully implemented neural network built from scratch using Python and NumPy. The primary goal of this project is to provide a clear understanding of how neural networks function under the hood, without relying on high-level libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.
