# Neural Network from Scratch

This repository contains a fully implemented neural network built from scratch using Python and NumPy. The primary goal of this project is to provide a clear understanding of how neural networks function under the hood, without relying on high-level libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.

## Features

- **Custom Neural Network Architecture**: Implemented a feedforward neural network with configurable input, hidden, and output layers.
- **Activation Functions**: Utilized ReLU and Sigmoid activation functions to introduce non-linearity.
- **Backpropagation Algorithm**: Implemented the backpropagation algorithm for training the network using gradient descent.
- **Training on MNIST Dataset**: Trained the network on the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits to classify images with high accuracy.
- **Loss Tracking**: Monitored and recorded loss during training for performance analysis.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- NumPy
- Keras (for loading the MNIST dataset)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/youness-marrakchi/Personal-Neural-NEtwork
